TO, HODSubject: Request for Subject Change from RM to CPRespected sir,I am Shauti Panchal currently in 6th semester of CSE-1 and I am waiting to request a subject change from Research Methodology (RM) to Competitive Programming (CP) for the current semester.I had already taken RM last semester and now I wish to explore CP to enhance my skills and growth in this field. As I am not opting for placements, I believe that taking this subject will help me focus on my personal aspirations.I kindly request your approval for this change.Thank you for your understanding and support.
