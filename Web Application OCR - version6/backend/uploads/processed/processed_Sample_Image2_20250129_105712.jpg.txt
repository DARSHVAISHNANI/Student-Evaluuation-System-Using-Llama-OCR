To, HODSubject: Request for subject change from RM to CPRespected sir,I am Shauti Panchal, currently in 6th semester of CSE-1. I am writing to request a subject change from Research Methodology (RM) to Competitive Programming (CP).I had already taken RM last semester and now wish to explore CP to enhance my skills and growth in this field.As I am not opting for placements, I believe this subject will help me focus on classes that align with my personal aspirations.I kindly request your approval for this change.Thank you for your understanding and support.
