To, HODSubject: Request for subject change from RM to CPRespected Sir,I am Shauti Panchal, currently in semester 6th/3rd year in CSE-1, awaiting to request a subject change from Research Methodology (RM) to Competitive Programming (CP) for the current semester.Recently, I had already taken RM last semester and now wish to explore CP to enhance my skills and growth in this field.As I am not opting for placements, I believe this subject will help me focus on classes that align with my personal aspirations.I kindly request your approval for this change. Thank you for your understanding and support.Sincerely,Shauti Panchal
