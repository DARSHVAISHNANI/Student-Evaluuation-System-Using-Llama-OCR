TO, HODSubject: Request for subject change from RM to CPRespected Sir,I am Shauti Panchal, currently in semester 6th/3rd year in CSE-1. I am writing to request a subject change from Research Methodology (RM) to Competitive Programming (CP) for the current semester.I had already taken RM last semester and now wish to explore CP to enhance my skills and growth in this field.As I am not opting for placements, I believe that focusing on CP will help me focus on areas that align with my personal aspirations.I kindly request your approval for this change. Thank you for your understanding and support.
