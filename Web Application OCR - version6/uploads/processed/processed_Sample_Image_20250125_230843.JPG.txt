Subject: Request for elective subject changeRespected sir,I am humbly requesting a change in my elective subject from Research methodology-2 to Competitive programming - 2. As I aim to pursue an M.Tech in India and focus on preparing for the GATE 2026 exam, I believe this change would better support my academic and career goals.Additionally, I wish to inform you that I will not be participating in the upcoming placement process. I would greatly appreciate your approval of this request.Thank you for your consideration,Vishwajit Sinh Chauhan
