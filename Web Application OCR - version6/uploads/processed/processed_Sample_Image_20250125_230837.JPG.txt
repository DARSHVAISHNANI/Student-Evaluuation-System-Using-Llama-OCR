Subject: Request for Effective Subject ChangeRespected Sir,I am writing to request a change in my elective subject from Research Methodology 2 to Competitive Programming - 2. As I aim to pursue an M.Tech in India and focus on preparing for the GATE 2026 exam, I believe this change would better support my academic and career goals.Additionally, I wish to inform you that I will not be participating in the upcoming placement process. I appreciate your approval of this request.Thank you for your consideration.Best regards,Vishavajitsinh Chauhan22CS014
